<h1>Eve Williams.</h1>
<h2>Everett Community College & GRAPH 130.</h2>
<h3>How many quarters have you attended EvCC?.</h3>
<p>I started in 2021 so I've attended 6 quarters so far.</p>
<h3>What degree/certificate program are you pursuing</h3>
<p>I'm aiming to get my degree in Graphic Design.</p>
<h3>Why did you choose this degree/certificate?</h3>
<p>I orginally wanted to get my degree in animation but EVCC does not have a animation course. I decided that I can still use my creativity in Graphic Design and I have been intrested in it too.</p>
<h3>What artist/designer inspires you? Why?</h3>
<p>James Baxter is an animator. He's been one for over a decade and I grew up watching his animations. He's such an insipration because of how much work he puts into every frame. He truly cares about his craft and is so amazing at what he does.</p>
<h3>What is your favorite color?</h3>
<p style="color: #FF69B4;">My favorite color is bubblegum pink.</p>
